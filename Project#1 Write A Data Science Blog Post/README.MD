## <a id="1">Introduction</a> 

Every year, Stack Overflow asks the developer community about everything from their favorite technologies to their job preferences. This year marks the tenth year that Stack Overflow has released the results of its annual developer survey - With nearly 65,000 responses fielded from over 180 countries and dependent territories, our 2020 Annual Developer Survey examines all aspects of the developer experience from career satisfaction and job search to education and opinions on open source software.

This year, they covered some new topics ranging from artificial intelligence to programming ethics. They also found that underrepresented groups in the tech industry responded to our survey at lower rates than we'd expect from their participation in the workforce.
